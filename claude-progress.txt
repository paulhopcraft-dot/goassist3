# GoAssist v3.0 Documentation Clarification - Progress Log

## Session 1 (2024-12-22): Initialization & RED-TEAM Review
- Loaded existing documentation set (7 documents)
- Performed comprehensive RED-TEAM document review
- Identified 45 clarity issues across all documents
- Categories: 18 ambiguity, 4 contradictions, 12 missing detail, 6 unclear ownership, 5 cross-document
- Created features.json with all findings as trackable items
- Prioritized top 10 blocking issues for operational deployment
- Set up project tracking structure

## Status
- Total features: 45
- P0-BLOCKING: 4 remaining (6 complete)
- P1: 15
- P2: 10
- Completed: 6
- In Progress: 0
- Blocked: 0

## Session 2 (2024-12-22): First Resolution - TMF-09
- ✅ Completed TMF-09: Define context rollover threshold
  - Set threshold at 7500 tokens (93.75% of 8192 hard cap)
  - Assigned orchestrator component as owner
  - Defined 5-second timeout for summarization
  - Specified failure handling: reject new turn with error
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 3.2, line 85-89
  - Unblocked IMP-04 (Implementation can now reference this threshold)

## Session 3 (2024-12-22): Second Resolution - TMF-05
- ✅ Completed TMF-05: Clarify barge-in measurement point
  - Specified measurement starts at server-side VAD detection event
  - Specified measurement ends at client audible stop (end-to-end)
  - Explicitly included server processing, network propagation, client buffer drain in 150ms budget
  - Added testing methodology: log server VAD timestamp, measure client audio stop
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 4.2, lines 137-143
  - Resolved operational testing ambiguity for implementation teams

## Session 4 (2024-12-23): Third Resolution - TMF-08
- ✅ Completed TMF-08: Specify TTFA latency percentile
  - Specified p95 as operational contract in section 1.2
  - Clarified section 6 budget is ideal-case (p50) allocation
  - Added note that actual p95 may exceed individual component budgets
  - Both p50 and p95 should be tracked; contract is p95 ≤ 250ms
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 1.2 line 33, section 6 notes lines 194-198
  - Resolved PRD-TMF percentile authority conflict
  - Unblocked CD-01 and PRD-01

## Session 5 (2024-12-23): Fourth Resolution - TMF-07
- ✅ Completed TMF-07: Define 24-hour extended soak in TMF
  - Defined as mixed-load operation with 30% active duty cycle
  - Active periods (30%): concurrent sessions at node capacity
  - Idle periods (70%): system ready, no active sessions
  - Pass criteria: no manual intervention, TTFA p95 ≤ 250ms, no OOM, no deadlocks
  - Added canonical inheritance clause for all documents
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 7.3, lines 214-221
  - Unblocked CD-02 (can now add cross-references to this definition)

## Session 6 (2024-12-23): Fifth Resolution - CD-02
- ✅ Completed CD-02: Define 24-hour soak test consistently (cross-document)
  - Added cross-references to TMF v3.0 section 7.3 in all 5 documents
  - PRD-v3.0.md: lines 150, 194, 212 (3 references)
  - Implementation-v3.0.md: line 400
  - Ops-Runbook-v3.0.md: line 367
  - Parallel-Dev-v3.0.md: lines 43, 121 (2 references)
  - TMF-v3.0-Addendum-A.md: line 84
  - Used standard format: "(per TMF v3.0 section 7.3)"
  - Completed soak definition chain: TMF-07 → CD-02 → (ADD-02, IMP-03 unblocked)

## Session 7 (2024-12-23): Sixth Resolution - TMF-11
- ✅ Completed TMF-11: Specify animation heartbeat frame threshold
  - Specified 100ms time-based threshold for slow-freeze trigger
  - Approximately 3 frames at 30fps, 6 frames at 60fps
  - Referenced 30-60Hz animation cadence from section 3.1
  - Added implementation note: use monotonic timer, not frame count
  - Time-based approach is FPS-agnostic and robust
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 4.3, lines 145-151

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining P0-BLOCKING issues (4 left)
2. Priority candidates: TMF-10 (latency overage), OPS-06 (env vars), OPS-08 (recovery authority)
3. CD-04 (model substitution liability) also available
4. Validate all changes preserve TMF authority hierarchy
