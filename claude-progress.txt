  - Already resolved during CD-02, verified line 400 has cross-reference
- Completed IMP-04: Specify context rollover threshold in Implementation
  - Added "context rollover threshold: 7500 tokens (per TMF v3.0 section 3.2)"
  - Updated Implementation-v3.0.md section 5.2, line 288
- Completed PRD-01: Resolve TTFA percentile with TMF

  - Aligns with TMF authority, cross-reference added
- Completed CD-01: Resolve TTFA percentile cross-document
  - Resolved by TMF-08 (TMF specifies p95) and PRD-01 alignment
  - Single source of truth established

## Session 14 (2024-12-24): P1 Batch #2 (3 issues)
- Completed IMP-02: Clarify SCOS usage constraints

  - Added "Audio clock definition" subsection to section 2.2
  - Clock source: system monotonic time (CLOCK_MONOTONIC, QueryPerformanceCounter)
  - Single-node: shared memory, no explicit sync needed
  - Multi-node: ±1ms tolerance, sync mechanism is implementation concern
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 2.2, lines 61-65
- Completed TMF-02: Define steady-state condition
  - Added steady-state definition under TTFA in section 1.2

## Next Steps
1. Continue P1 issues (5 remaining)
2. Consider CD-03 (now unblocked by IMP-02)
3. Validate all changes preserve TMF authority hierarchy
