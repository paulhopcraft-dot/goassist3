# GoAssist v3.0 Documentation Clarification - Progress Log

## Session 1 (2024-12-22): Initialization & RED-TEAM Review
- Loaded existing documentation set (7 documents)
- Performed comprehensive RED-TEAM document review
- Identified 45 clarity issues across all documents
- Categories: 18 ambiguity, 4 contradictions, 12 missing detail, 6 unclear ownership, 5 cross-document
- Created features.json with all findings as trackable items
- Prioritized top 10 blocking issues for operational deployment
- Set up project tracking structure

## Status
- Total features: 45
- P0-BLOCKING: 7 remaining (3 complete)
- P1: 15
- P2: 10
- Completed: 3
- In Progress: 0
- Blocked: 1 (IMP-04 unblocked, ADD-02 still blocked, CD-01 and PRD-01 now unblocked)

## Session 2 (2024-12-22): First Resolution - TMF-09
- ✅ Completed TMF-09: Define context rollover threshold
  - Set threshold at 7500 tokens (93.75% of 8192 hard cap)
  - Assigned orchestrator component as owner
  - Defined 5-second timeout for summarization
  - Specified failure handling: reject new turn with error
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 3.2, line 85-89
  - Unblocked IMP-04 (Implementation can now reference this threshold)

## Session 3 (2024-12-22): Second Resolution - TMF-05
- ✅ Completed TMF-05: Clarify barge-in measurement point
  - Specified measurement starts at server-side VAD detection event
  - Specified measurement ends at client audible stop (end-to-end)
  - Explicitly included server processing, network propagation, client buffer drain in 150ms budget
  - Added testing methodology: log server VAD timestamp, measure client audio stop
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 4.2, lines 137-143
  - Resolved operational testing ambiguity for implementation teams

## Session 4 (2024-12-23): Third Resolution - TMF-08
- ✅ Completed TMF-08: Specify TTFA latency percentile
  - Specified p95 as operational contract in section 1.2
  - Clarified section 6 budget is ideal-case (p50) allocation
  - Added note that actual p95 may exceed individual component budgets
  - Both p50 and p95 should be tracked; contract is p95 ≤ 250ms
  - Updated TMF-v3.0.md section 1.2 line 33, section 6 notes lines 194-198
  - Resolved PRD-TMF percentile authority conflict
  - Unblocked CD-01 and PRD-01

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining P0-BLOCKING issues (7 left)
2. Priority candidates: TMF-07 (24h soak definition), CD-02 (24h soak consistency), TMF-11 (animation frames)
3. Note: TMF-07 must be resolved before CD-02 (dependency)
4. Validate all changes preserve TMF authority hierarchy
